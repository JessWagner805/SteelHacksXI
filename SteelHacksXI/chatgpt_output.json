  "Strategy": "Malenia is a formidable boss known for her swift attacks and healing abilities. To maximize your chances of defeating her, using the Giant-Crusher for its staggering ability can be effective, but it requires careful timing and stamina management due to its slow attack speed. Equip the Veteran's Set for high damage absorption. Use the spell 'Flame, Grant me strength' to increase your attack power and 'Protection of the Erdtree' for enhanced defense. A mix of aggressive combat and cautious positioning is key. Utilize consumables like Crimson Tears for health restoration. Focus on evading her waterfowl dance by dashing to her side or behind, and strike during her recovery phases. Consistent pressure and optimized use of your Tears combination during the second phase can turn the tide in your favor."
